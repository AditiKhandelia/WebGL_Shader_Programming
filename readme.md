## Contents
- `Khandelia_220061_Assignment1/` :
    - This directory contains the first assignment which introduces basic WebGL concepts and shader programming.
    - A primitive scene is rendered using vertex and fragment shaders.
- `Khandelia_220061_Assignment2/`
    - This assignment explores the various shading techniques in WebGL.
    - It implements ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting models.
    - The shaders are designed to demonstrate how light interacts with surfaces in a 3D environment.
    - The scene includes multiple light sources and different materials to showcase the effects of lighting.
    - It includes examples of flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading.
- `Khandelia_220061_Assignment3/`
    - This assignment explores various lighting models and their implementation in shaders.
    - Various shading techniques are demonstrated, including:
        - Cubemap Reflection
        - Refraction
        - Fragment Discarding
        - Texture Mapping
        - Skybox Rendering
- `Khandelia_220061_Assignment4/`
    - This assignment uses the two-pass rendering technique along with framebuffer objects (FBOs) to create shadow maps.
    - It demonstrates how to render shadows in a 3D scene using depth textures.
- `Khandelia_220061_Assignment5/`
    - This assignment uses Ray Tracing in fragment shaders to create realistic shadows and reflections.
    - It demonstrates how ray tracing can be used to achieve effects that are difficult to implement with traditional rasterization techniques.
    - The shaders are designed to handle complex lighting interactions and produce high-quality visuals.
